        This solution was submitted and prepared by Michał Postawka JLOOLW for the Messengers assignment of the Web Programming course. 
        I declare that this solution is my own work. 
        I have not copied or used third party solutions. 
        I have not passed my solution to my classmates, neither  made it public. 
        Students’ regulation of Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C. § ) states 
        that as long as a student presents another student’s work - or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance, 
        it will count as a disciplinary fault. 
        The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the student from the University.
